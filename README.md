<h4>Good practice with basic Javascript, number counter with the possibility of increasing and decreasing for a number chosen by us with the possibility of resetting.

Css file for a better style, html file with simple label form and button and js file with DOM manipulation with getElement and three logic functions for the various buttons </h4>
